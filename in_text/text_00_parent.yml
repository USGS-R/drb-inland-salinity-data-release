  Estimating Stream Salinity Impairment Across the Delaware River Basin Using Space- and Time-Aware Machine Learning 

abstract: >-

  Stream salinity has been increasing for the last four decades across the Delaware River Basin (DRB), 
  partially due to groundwater storage and release of road salt that is applied for deicing. If left unmanaged,
  this can have proximate consequences for infrastructure and ecosystems. This data release contains data used for
  by the Machine learning models aimed at integrating finer-scale spacio-temporal dynamics to estimate stream salinity across
  the Delaware River Basin and provide insight into salinity-impaired reaches and the processes that drive changes in stream salinity across the DRB,
  which is critical to informed salinity management. This data release includes data that characterize both
  rivers and a subset of reservoirs in the basin.
  

  The data are stored in 4 child folders: 1) spatial information, 2) observations, and 3) model driver data, 4) predictions

  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/XX"> 1) Spatial Information </a>- [CHANGE] Spatial data used for modeling efforts in the Delaware River Basin</li> -
  a shapefile of polylines for the river segments, point data for observation locations, and polygons for the three (Pepacton, Cannonsville, and Neversink) reservoirs in this dataset.
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/XX"> 2) Observations </a>- [CHANGE] Reservoir (surface levels, releases, diversions, water temperature) and river (water temperature and flow)
  observations that can be used to train and test water quality models. </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/XX"> 3) Model driver data </a>- [CHANGE] Driver data used to force water quality models, including
  stream reach distance matrices and daily meteorology data from NOAA GEFS and gridMET. This child item also
  includes the inputs and outputs of an uncalibrated run of PRMS-SNTemp which predicts mean water temperature
  at all reaches in the DRB.
