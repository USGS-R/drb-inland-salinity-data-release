      attr-label: subsegid
      attr-def: >-
        An alternative unique reach identifier which was created in order to split segments such that 
        segment start and endpoints were connected by one reach with no intersecting reaches. The ID was created
        using the seg_id from the Geospatial Fabric and an index from one to the number of splits (e.g., {subseg_id}_{index}). 
        This feature corresponds to subseg_id in other files.

    data-description: >- 
      GIS point data for flow and temperature monitoring sites in the Delaware River Basin.
      
      
      Sites represent all sites within the Delaware River Basin boundary that were retrieved from
      EcoSHEDS, Water Quality Portal, or the National Water Information System. Sites were limited to those
      that matched to our stream network and that met our distance critera (fish distance < 20,000 m and bird distance < 250 m).
      Some sites are duplicated (multiple rows per site_id); these duplicated sites mean that the same site appeared
      in more than one database.
      
      
      Sites were matched to the closest river reach from the Geospatial Fabric v1.1, by Euclidean distance, 
      from the monitoring site latitude and longitude.
      Sites represent all sites within the Delaware River Basin boundary that were retrieved from
      EcoSHEDS, Water Quality Portal, or the National Water Information System. Sites were limited to those
      that matched to our stream network and that met our distance critera (fish distance < 20,000 m and bird distance < 250 m).
      Once the original reach match was assigned, the matched segment was reassigned if the endpoint of the 
      upstream reach was closer to the monitoring site (by river distance) than the endpoint of the matched reach.
      If the upstream endpoint was closer, but there was a confluence directly upstream, then the original match
      was kept.
